### <a name="description"></a>1. Description

A repository holds music sheets for accordion 
(particularly B-griff button accordion) engraved in 
[Lilypond](http://lilypond.org/), a high-quality, free and
open source music typesetting program.


### <a name="quickstart"  ></a>2. Quick start: Creating Music Sheet & Midi using LilyPond

1. Locate yourself in a directory of a music piece on a Linux-based machine:

`make`

The simplistic Makefile will invoke LilyPond, generate a pdf of
the sheet music along with the [`MIDI`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIDI) file.

### <a name="related"     ></a>3. Related Sources


[Sources](https://github.com/cellist/Lilypond-Sheet-Music) of 
[Cellist](https://github.com/cellist) were used as a basis  
and adapted for accordion. 

### <a name="rationale"   ></a>4. Rationale

As already quite a large code base of music engraved in LilyPond exists on the 
[github](https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=lilypond&type=), 
the goal is to:
(i) provide functional examples of music engraving & midi generation 
**for accordion** using LilyPond, 
(ii) to share my rusty arrangements.
